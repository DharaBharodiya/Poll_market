Polls are a type of survey that aims to collect information from a large group of people in a short amount of time.These surveys typically focus on a single question or topic and provide respondents with limited answer choices. Polls are frequently used in political research, as they provide a quick and efficient way to gauge public opinion on specific issues or candidates.

A poll can be conducted through various methods, including telephone, online, or in-person interviews. Online polls have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their cost-effectiveness and the ease of distributing them through social media and other digital channels.

One of the defining characteristics of polls is their brevity. Unlike traditional surveys that can consist of dozens of questions, a poll typically consists of one or two questions with a limited number of response options. This makes them useful for gathering quick insights on a specific topic or issue.

Businesses and organizations often use polls to gather information about consumer preferences and behavior. For example, a company might poll to find out which of their products is most popular among a certain demographic or to gather feedback on a recent advertising campaign.

Despite their brevity, polls can provide valuable insights into public opinion and consumer behavior. However, it is important to ensure that they are conducted rigorously and unbiasedly to produce accurate results.
